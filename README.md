# yFiles integration for Angular CLI

This sample application serves as a basic scaffold of how to integrate [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html) in an [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) application.

**To run this project, a valid [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html) version is required. You can evaluate yFiles 60 days free of charge on [my.yworks.com](https://my.yworks.com/signup?product=YFILES_HTML_EVAL).**

## Version Information

- Angular CLI v16.0
- yFiles for HTML 2.6

## Getting Started

Just clone this repository with

```
git clone https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-angular-integration-basic
```

Then, extract a yFiles Evaluation package beside it and run

```
npm install
```

You can serve the application on [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) with

```
npm run start
```

## Under the Hood

This project is a default Angular CLI application, where yFiles was added as an additional dependency to integrate a basic graph component.

A step-by-step description of how to integrate yFiles in an Angular application can be found [here](integration-howto.md).

## What's next?

This basic yFiles integration can be used as a starting point to test the capabilities of yFiles or to implement your own use case. yFiles for HTML comes with a lot of [source-code demos](https://live.yworks.com/demos/index.html) that show different aspects of the library.

You can browse through the demos and look for features that you find interesting for your use case and integrate it in this basic component to build a more sophisticated application.

The yFiles package also contains a bigger [Angular CLI integration demo](https://live.yworks.com/demos/toolkit/angular/index.html) ([GitHub](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-for-html-demos/tree/master/demos/toolkit/angular)) as well as an [AngularJS 1 integration demo](https://live.yworks.com/demos/toolkit/angular1/index.html) ([GitHub](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-for-html-demos/tree/master/demos/toolkit/angular1)).

Furthermore, there is an extensive [Developer's Guide](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/introduction#top) that covers anything from graph creation and styling to automatic layouts and advanced customizations.

## Create a Diagram Application with Angular

The [App Generator](https://www.yworks.com/products/app-generator) is a tool that lets you interactively create a diagram
application prototype to visualize your data. Select features like editing, context menu, graph search, or printing
and customize the interaction with the graph. Generate Angular code for your prototype and use it with a valid
[yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html) version.
